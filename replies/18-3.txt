Do you regularly use two-factor authentication?
Your response: Not sure

This is understandable, as a number of online accounts have it enabled by default now. If you've ever received a code by text or by email that you had to type in after entering your password, then you have used two-factor authentication. I recommended that you enable 2FA on 𝐚𝐥𝐥 online accounts that support it.

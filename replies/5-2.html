Question: How familiar are you with the term anti-virus?
Your answer: Somewhat familiar

Good! Anti-virus is a piece of software which detects and removes viruses (and often other types of malware) from your computer. This means that if you click on a dangerous link in an email, or plug in a USB stick with some malicious code on it, anti-virus will try and protect you.

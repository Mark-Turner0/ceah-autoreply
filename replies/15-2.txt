How many passwords do you regularly use?
Your response: 4 or 5

Using multiple passwords is always good - it means that if hackers get 𝐨𝐧𝐞 of your passwords, then they don't have access to 𝐚𝐥𝐥 your accounts. But you probably have more than 4 or 5 accounts, right? You should really be using a different password for each account you have. 

They can be hard to remember, so I recommended that you 𝐮𝐬𝐞 𝐚 𝐩𝐚𝐬𝐬𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐝 𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐫 to do this. Password managers can generate and store passwords for 𝐚𝐥𝐥 of your accounts, and you only have to remember 𝐨𝐧𝐞 master password. Make sure this master password is extremely secure!

	<p style="text-align:left;">Dear [X],</p>
	<p>As you may know, I am completing a master's course in Computer Security at the University of Manchester.<br><br>
	As part of this course, I need to complete a project for my dissertation, and I am wondering if you can help me with this.<br><br>
	It would also help you to improve your cyber security, especially important at this time when more and more people are working online!<br><br>
	All I would like you to do is:</p>
	<br>
	<ol type="1">
		<li>Fill out a short survey</li>
		<li>Install a small piece of software on your computer which checks your cyber security (can be uninstalled at any time you wish)</li>
		<li>Watch a few videos and point out cyber security flaws</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
	<p>Your data will be kept securely in accordance with the GDPR, and you can withdraw from the study at any time without giving any reason.</p>
	<p>If you have any questions, reply to this email! Hope you can help me!</p>
